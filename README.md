# Print_r Converter

The Print_r Converter a PHP tool that is able to convert `print_r()`-output back to PHP code.

It has grown out of Stackoverflow where users were pasting array data from [`print_r()`](http://php.net/print_r) in their questions.

An online demo is kindly hosted by [Appfog](https://www.appfog.com/) here: [Online print_r() converter](http://phpoverflow.eu01.aws.af.cm/print_r/).

:underage: If you prefer to use some different host, you can do so thanks to the effors of [Webarto](http://stackoverflow.com/users/424004/webarto) at [print-r.co](http://print-r.co/) albeit it is an unlicensed copy so I can not provide any support for it atm.
